Description: Routines to construct general P-splines for non-uniform B-splines on arbitrary knots, proposed by Li and Cao (2022) <arXiv:2201.06808>. This P-spline variant extends the standard P-splines of Eilers and Marx (1996) <doi:10.1214/ss/1038425655> that are tailored for uniform B-splines on equidistant knots. Includes SparseD() for computing general difference matrices, SparseS() for computing derivative penalty matrix or its sparse root using a sandwich formula, etc. Also includes several demos on B-splines and P-splines. Aims to facilitate other packages to implement general P-splines as a smoothing tool in their model estimation framework.
